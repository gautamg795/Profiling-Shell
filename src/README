If our program finds a syntax error in the input file, it may continue
outputting standard format for all commands found before the syntax error and
then note the line number of the syntax error and exit the program. However,
since this was later deemed unnecessary, other syntax errors may terminate the
program immediately with just an error message. 

After implementing the standard execution model for our shell, we have no
additional features that we would like to call to your attention.
